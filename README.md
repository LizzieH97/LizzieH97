- 👋 Hi, I’m Lizzie! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- :100: I completed two intenside coding "boot-camp" courses - one with Northcoder and one with _nology. With Northcoders, I learnt a LOT about software development - the biggest takeaways from this course were the experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, NodeJS, Vite, Next.JS, SupaBase, SuperTest, Jest and TailwindCSS. I also collaborated with many other participants on the boot camp through Pair Programming and our final project BiteSize Habits. With my _nology course, I developed these skills further and explored TypeScript, Java, Springboot, Scala, Play framework and MySQL. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scala through _nology upskilling and becoming more confident with the Java that I have learnt. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational websites and apps. I tutor both mathematics and Spanish in my spare time. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also own a crochet business! It's called LHCrochetCrochet and I crochet plush toys and earrings. Check us out on Instagram and Facebook!
