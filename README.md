- 👋 Hi, I’m Lizzie! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- :100: I have just finished a JavaScript bootcamp with Northcoders where I learnt a LOT about software development. The biggest takeaways from this course were the experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, NodeJS, Vite, Next.JS, SupaBase, SuperTest, Jest and TailwindCSS. I also collaborated with many other participants on the boot camp through Pair Programming and our final project BiteSize Habits
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript and becoming more confident with Next.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational websites and apps. I tutor both mathematics and Spanish in my spare time and I'd love to create an app to make maths GCSE easier for students!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I also own a crochet business! It's called LHCrochetCrochet and I crochet plush toys and earrings. Check us out on Instagram and Facebook!
